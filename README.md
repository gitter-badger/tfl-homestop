# tfl-homestop
An exercise into creating a series of basic user interfaces using various different front end technologies to display information about your personal TfL modes of transport and locations. This repo will have multiple sub projects.

The intention here is to use existing knowledge of the public TfL API to access information and display it to the end user.

Each sub project in this repo will use a different technology (ReactJS, Angular2, Aurelia, etc) and the plan is to demonstrate the creation of individual websites (sub domains maybe) for each. And additionaly to create an IOS and Android apps to show the same features.

As the project grows the intention is to extend the features, but to start with let's keep things simple.

The first feature will be to:

* allow the user to select a tube station
* save the tube station so that the user does not need to select again on next visit (but they can change it)
* display the current information/status of the tube station (not display train times, yet!)
